# CAI Soft binding API

The soft binding resolution API is a web API providing a standard way of retrieving C2PA manifest stores from a soft binding resolution API endpoint given a soft binding value, a manifest identifier, or an asset.

C2PA specifies a mechanism for recovering a C2PA manifest for an asset, for example when the metadata containing the C2PA manifest has been stripped. This mechanism is a _soft binding_ (for example an invisible watermark or content fingerprint). The soft binding is used to look up the C2PA manifest within a Manifest Repository. The soft binding is described by the soft binding assertion.
